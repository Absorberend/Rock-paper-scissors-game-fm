# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is my solution for the "Rock Paper Scissors Game" challenge of Frontend Mentor.

What I like about Frontend Mentor is that they give you some details about what they like to see and sometimes some images but that's about it.
You're not given a solution so it's all on you to try and recreate the project as accurately as possible.

This was my first ever App build in React. I learned alot about working in modules, uplifting state, working with JSX for the first time and working with a custom hook for a graffeti animation package. If you have any tips please let me know!
